I implemented Depth-First Search (DFS) which uses a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack.
I ran GreedySearch() with Kitchener as the root node (init_state) and Listowel as (goal_name).
I built a search tree which included the heuristic function and included the locations below.
∗ Kitchener : 130
∗ Guelph : 160
∗ Drayton : 100
∗ New Hamburg : 110
∗ Stratford : 100
∗ St. Marys : 130
∗ Mitchell : 100
I recorded and returned the path (i.e. sequence of nodes) that GreedySearch() took to reach the
goal.
